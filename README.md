# SuperSafe
Emergency Call System in Android (this is an application that you activate before you might get into an emergency situation (i.e. before walking alone through a tunnel). Then you have to press a button (or a finger on the screen...) and as soon as you lift the finger from that button/screen, the device will send an emergency call to a friend/the police and send the current position, sound and video to another device or to an internet portal)
